// Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. These numbers are added to produce s[7:0]. Also compute whether a (signed) overflow has occurred.

// Hint: A signed overflow occurs when adding two positive numbers produces a negative result, or adding two negative numbers produces a positive result. There are several methods to detect overflow: It could be computed by comparing the signs of the input and output numbers, or derived from the carry-out of bit n and n-1.
