// For the following Karnaugh map, give the circuit implementation using one 4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using as few as possible. You are not allowed to use any other logic gate and you must use a and b as the multiplexer selector inputs, as shown on the 4-to-1 multiplexer below.

// You are implementing just the portion labelled top_module, such that the entire circuit (including the 4-to-1 mux) implements the K-map.
