// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has bit[3]=1 (but bit[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data).

// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with bit[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).


//Now that you have a state machine that will identify three-byte messages in a PS/2 byte stream, add a datapath that will also output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

// out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care).


// Hint: Use the FSM from PS/2 packet parser and add a datapath to capture the incoming bytes.
    
// FSM from fsm_ps2
// New: Datapath to store incoming bytes.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [23:0] out_bytes,
    output done);
