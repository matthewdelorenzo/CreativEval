// You're familiar with flip-flops that are triggered on the positive edge of the clock, or negative edge of the clock. A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock. However, FPGAs don't have dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) is not accepted as a legal sensitivity list.

// Build a circuit that functionally behaves like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop

// Hint: You can't create a dual-edge triggered flip-flop on an FPGA. But you can create both positive-edge triggered and negative-edge triggered flip-flops.
// This problem is a moderately difficult circuit design problem, but requires only basic Verilog language features. (This is a circuit design problem, not a coding problem.) It may help to first sketch a circuit by hand before attempting to code it.
