// Create a module that implements a NOR gate. 
// A NOR gate is an OR gate with its output inverted. 
// A NOR function needs two operators when written in Verilog.

// Hint: Verilog has separate bitwise-OR (|) and logical-OR (||) operators, like C. 
// Since we're working with a one-bit here, it doesn't matter which we choose.

    input a,
