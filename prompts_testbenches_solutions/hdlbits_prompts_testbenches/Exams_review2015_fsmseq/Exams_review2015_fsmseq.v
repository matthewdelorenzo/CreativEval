// Build a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,      // Synchronous reset
    input data,
    output start_shifting);
