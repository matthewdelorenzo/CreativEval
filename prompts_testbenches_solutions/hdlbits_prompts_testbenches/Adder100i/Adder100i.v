// Create a 100-bit binary ripple-carry adder by instantiating 100 full adders. 
// The adder adds two 100-bit numbers and a carry-in to produce a 100-bit sum and carry out. 
// To encourage you to actually instantiate full adders, 
// also output the carry-out from each full adder in the ripple-carry adder. 
// cout[99] is the final carry-out from the last full adder, and is the carry-out you usually see.

// Hint: There are many full adders to instantiate. An instance array or generate statement would help here.
