// Design a 1-12 counter with the following inputs and outputs:

// Reset Synchronous active-high reset that forces the counter to 1
// Enable Set high for the counter to run
// Clk Positive edge-triggered clock input
// Q[3:0] The output of the counter
// c_enable, c_load, c_d[3:0] Control signals going to the provided 4-bit counter, so correct operation can be verified.


// You have the following components available:
// First, the 4-bit binary counter (count4) below, which has Enable and synchronous parallel-load inputs (load has higher priority than enable). The count4 module is provided to you. Instantiate it in your circuit.
// Second, logic gates

// The c_enable, c_load, and c_d outputs are the signals that go to the internal counter's enable, load, and d inputs, respectively. Their purpose is to allow these signals to be checked for correctness.
