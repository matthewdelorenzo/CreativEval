// Given several input vectors, concatenate them together then split them 
// up into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: 
// a, b, c, d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. 
// There are four 8-bit output vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. 
// The output should be a concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits.
