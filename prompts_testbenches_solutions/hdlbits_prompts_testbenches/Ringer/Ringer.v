// Suppose you are designing a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor. 
// Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call (input ring), your circuit must either 
// turn on the ringer (output ringer = 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. 
// If the phone is in vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn on the ringer.

// Try to use only assign statements, to see whether you can translate a problem description into a collection of logic gates.

// Design hint: When designing circuits, one often has to think of the problem "backwards", 
// starting from the outputs then working backwards towards the inputs. This is often the opposite 
// of how one would think about a (sequential, imperative) programming problem, where one would look 
// at the inputs first then decide on an action (or output). For sequential programs, one would 
// often think "If (inputs are ___ ) then (output should be ___ )". On the other hand, hardware 
// designers often think "The (output should be ___ ) when (inputs are ___ )".
// For this particular problem, one should be thinking "The motor is on when ___", rather than "If (vibrate mode) then ___".
