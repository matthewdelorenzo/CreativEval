// Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second).

// reset resets the clock to 12:00 AM. pm is 0 for AM and 1 for PM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59). Reset has higher priority than enable, and can occur even when not enabled.

// Hint: Note that 11:59:59 PM advances to 12:00:00 AM, and 12:59:59 PM advances to 01:00:00 PM. There is no 00:00:00.
