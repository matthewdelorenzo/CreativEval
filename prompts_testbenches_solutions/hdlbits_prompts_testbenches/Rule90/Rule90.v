// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.
