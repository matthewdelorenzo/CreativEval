// Parity checking is often used as a simple method of detecting errors when 
// transmitting data through an imperfect channel. Create a circuit that will 
// compute a parity bit for a 8-bit byte (which will add a 9th bit to the byte). 
// We will use "even" parity, where the parity bit is just the XOR of all 8 data bits.
