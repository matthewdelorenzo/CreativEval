// Implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care a particular cell in the following map, which means you may choose to output whatever value is convenient.

// Try to simplify the k-map before coding it. Try both product-of-sums and sum-of-products forms. We can't check whether you have the optimal simplification of the k-map. But we can check if your reduction is equivalent, and we can check whether you can translate a k-map into a circuit.
