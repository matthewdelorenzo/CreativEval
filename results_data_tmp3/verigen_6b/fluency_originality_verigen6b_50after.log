// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer with one input that:

// first, is started when a particular input pattern (1101) is detected,
// second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// fifth, The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, // most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

// At that point, the circuit must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The circuit should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Hint: It's ok to have all the code in a single module if the components are in their own always blocks, as long as it's clear which blob of code corresponds to which hardware block. Don't merge multiple always blocks together, as that's hard to read and error-prone.

// We want to create a timer that:

// First, is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
// Second, shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
// Third, waits for the counters to finish counting, and
// Fourth, notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
// Fifth, In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.

// The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles.

// After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.

// At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

// The state machine should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

// Build a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

// Build a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

// Build a finite-state machine that searches for the sequence 1101 in an input bit stream. When the sequence is found, it should set start_shifting to 1, forever, until reset. Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

Getting stuck in the final state is intended to model going to other states in a bigger FSM that is not yet implemented. We will be extending this FSM in the next few exercises.

// The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has bit[3]=1 (but bit[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data).

// We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with bit[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).


//Now that you have a state machine that will identify three-byte messages in a PS/2 byte stream, add a datapath that will also output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.).

// out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care).

// In many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle).

// Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

// We want to add parity checking to the serial receiver. Parity checking adds one extra bit after each data byte. We will use odd parity, where the number of 1s in the 9 bits received must be odd. For example, 101001011 satisfies odd parity (there are 5 1s), but 001001011 does not.

// Change your FSM and datapath to perform odd parity checking. Assert the done signal only if a byte is correctly received and its parity check passes. Like the serial receiver FSM, this FSM needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 9 (data and parity) bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct.

Output:  // We want to add parity checking to the serial receiver. Parity checking adds one extra bit after each data byte. We will use odd parity, where the number of 1s in the 9 bits received must be odd. For example, 101001011 satisfies odd parity (there are 5 1s), but 001001011 does not.

// Change your FSM and datapath to perform odd parity checking. Assert the done signal only if a byte is correctly received and its parity check passes. Like the serial receiver FSM, this FSM needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 9 (data and parity) bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

// You are provided with the following module that can be used to calculate the parity of the input stream (It's a TFF with reset). The intended use is that it should be given the input bit stream, and reset at appropriate times so it counts the number of 1 bits in each byte.

For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99].
//out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0].
//out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[98] should indicate if in[98] is different from in[99]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[99]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].


// Hint: Using vectors, this can still be done in 3 assign statements.

module top_module( 
    input [99:0] in,
    output [98:0] out_both,
    output [99:1] out_any,

    assign out_both = in[99:1] & in[98:0];
    assign out_any  = in[98:0] | in[99:1];
    assign out_different = in ^ {in[0], in[99:1]};   //因为out_different要求一个wrapping且xor比较左边，故采用in[99:0] ^ {in[0], in[99:1]}

// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).

// There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	1
// 1	0	0	0
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	1
// 0	0	1	1

// (The name "Rule 110" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01101110 is decimal 110.)

// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//       1
//      11
//     111
//    1101
//   11111
//  110001
// 1110011

// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).

// There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	1
// 1	0	0	0
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	1
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 110" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01101110 is decimal 110.)

// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:

// Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties (such as being Turing-complete).

// There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself and its two neighbours, according to the following table:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	1
// 1	0	0	0
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	1
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 110" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01101110 is decimal 110.)

// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//       1
//      11
//     111
//    1101
//   11111
//  110001
// 1110011

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1
// 0	1	0	0
// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Hint: For an initial state of q[511:0] = 1, the first few iterations are:
//        1
//       10
//      101
//     1000
//    10100
//   100010
//  1010101
// 10000000
// This forms half of a Sierpiński triangle.

// Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties.

// The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours. A more verbose way of expressing this rule is the following table, where a cell's next state is a function of itself and its two neighbours:

// Left	Center	Right	Center's next state
// 1	1	1	0
// 1	1	0	1
// 1	0	1	0
// 1	0	0	1
// 0	1	1	1

// 0	0	1	1
// 0	0	0	0
// (The name "Rule 90" comes from reading the "next state" column: 01011010 is decimal 90.)


// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).

// Build a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.

// An arithmetic right shift shifts in the sign bit of the number in the shift register (q[63] in this case) instead of zero as done by a logical right shift. Another way of thinking about an arithmetic right shift is that it assumes the number being shifted is signed and preserves the sign, so that arithmetic right shift divides a signed number by a power of two.

// There is no difference between logical and arithmetic left shifts.

// load: Loads shift register with data[63:0] instead of shifting.
// ena: Chooses whether to shift.
// amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
// 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
// 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
// 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
// 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.
// q: The contents of the shifter.

// Hint: A 5-bit number 11000 arithmetic right-shifted by 1 is 11100, while a logical right shift would produce 01100.
// Similarly, a 5-bit number 01000 arithmetic right-shifted by 1 is 00100, and a logical right shift would produce the same result, because the original number was non-negative.

// Build a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.

// An arithmetic right shift shifts in the sign bit of the number in the shift register (q[63] in this case) instead of zero as done by a logical right shift. Another way of thinking about an arithmetic right shift is that it assumes the number being shifted is signed and preserves the sign, so that arithmetic right shift divides a signed number by a power of two.

// There is no difference between logical and arithmetic left shifts.

// load: Loads shift register with data[63:0] instead of shifting.
// ena: Chooses whether to shift.
// amount: Chooses which direction and how much to shift.
// 2'b00: shift left by 1 bit.
// 2'b01: shift left by 8 bits.
// 2'b10: shift right by 1 bit.
// 2'b11: shift right by 8 bits.
// q: The contents of the shifter.

// Hint: A 5-bit number 11000 arithmetic right-shifted by 1 is 11100, while a logical right shift would produce 01100.
// Similarly, a 5-bit number 01000 arithmetic right-shifted by 1 is 00100, and a logical right shift would produce the same result, because the original number was non-negative.
